# EE266 Digital Synthesis Script

---
## Purpose

This repository automates the digital synthesis and layout generation for control circuitry in a SAR ADC.  
Developed as part of the UCSD EE266 course, the script takes Verilog input and configuration files to produce an optimized GDSII layout.

## Tools Used

- **Genus**: `21.16-s062_1`
- **Innovus**: `v21.16-s078_1`

## Required Libraries

Ensure the following TSMC65 6X1Z1U PDK and digital standard cell libraries are available in the `DigTech/` folder:

- `qrcTechFile.typical`
- `tcbn65gplus_macro.lef`
- `tsmcN65_HVH_9M_6X1Z1U_RDL.lef`
- `tcbn65gplustc.lib`
- `tsmcN65_6X1Z1U.map`

> Note: The LEF files are split into macro and routing parts to support flexible backend routing rules and DRC updates.  
Refer to the Cadence *Mixed-Signal (MS) Interoperability Guide* for more details.
